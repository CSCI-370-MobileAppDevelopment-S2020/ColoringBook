repo for Semester Project Coloring Book
Welcome to our coloring book app. We believe it is simple, yet very satisfactory. 
The main activity includes a grid layout of buttons pertaining to the theme of image 
you want to color. Belo the grid of buttons lies a sketch pad to doodle on to get used
to the drawing mechanics. Once a button is pressed, an activity is opened that displays 
2 possible images to be drawn and colored. Once you have decided whihc image to draw, 
simply click it and it will take you to another activity that will display the image \
clicked, along with a larger version of the sketch pad to draw on.
